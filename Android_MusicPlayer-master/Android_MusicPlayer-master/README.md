This is a simple music player app I made in android studio using java. This is my first big project, on which I spent a good amount of time. 
# About
The music player reads music from the media store and displays them in a recycler view. 
Initially, the song name is displayed in a bottom text view and can be controlled using the buttons in the bottom bar. If the bottom bar is clicked, second activity is launched which has advanced controls. 
# Key Takeawayas
- Helped improve OOP skills
- Helped understand how android phone storage is fromatted
- Learned about front-end in android (XML)
- Helped better understand android studio IDE and debugging mode 
# Comming Soon
- Exclude songs less than 60 seconds long

    Since the songs displays .mp3 files from the media store, it also displays ringtones and notification sounds. These can be filtered out     as all of these ringtones are less than 60 seconds long. 
- Functionality to chose files to read .mp3 files from

    This will give user free acess to read files from which ever folder they like. This will help them have more control over the songs         being displayed and will help them better organize the phone storage. 
- Notification and Lockscreen activity

    This will help the user have acess to the songs being played even if the app isn't opened or if the phone is locked.
